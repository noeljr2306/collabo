# Collabo

**Collabo** is a real-time code collaboration platform designed for developers. It enables seamless pair programming, team collaboration, and instant code sharing without the hassle of merge conflicts or complex setups.

**Note:** This project is currently under development. Features may be incomplete, and breaking changes are expected.

## Features

- **Live Code Collaboration**: Watch teammates code line-by-line in real-time, just like pair programming.
- **Real-Time Chat**: Integrated chat system for discussing, debugging, and brainstorming.
- **Secure Authentication**: Create or join rooms safely with a robust authentication system.
- **Join or Create Rooms**: Jump into existing sessions or start your own coding room with a simple room code.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Supports popular programming languages like JavaScript, Python, and more—no setup required.
- **Auto-Save & Sync**: Never lose progress; code syncs across devices in real-time.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
